This is advanced app to create box shadow in CSS. The application was created in August 2021.

Opossite to other apps that can make box shadow in this app you can work with layers of a box shadow.
It means you can edit more than 1 shadow in one time and make amazing shadows simply.

* There is a lot of prepared effect that you can use.
* In nav bar you can choose tools. At this moment there is a one tool: **Import shadow** - As the name says you can import shadow from code in CSS. (That option doesn't works corretly xD)
